## About
Uber CMS is a simple content management system designed to give its users control over their site, and the ability to design their site like how they want. It uses HTML with PHP includes rather than Markdown. Uber CMS was made with the non-commercial Internet and software freedom in mind.

## Prerequisites
  - [PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor](https://www.php.net/)

## Installation
  1. Edit `uberwiki.php`. (The values that need changed have comments explaining what would need changed)
  2. Create `includes/header.html`, and `includes/footer.html`
  3. Create `pages/main.html` and other html files
  4. Add any necessary files to `includes/` such as CSS or JavaScript, and link them accordingly in your site's header or footer.
